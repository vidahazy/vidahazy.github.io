**The Impact of Natural Disasters on Capital Flows: Exposure and Preparedness**

*-available at request*

Climate and weather-related natural catastrophes have caused 74% of all disaster-related economic losses over the past fifty years. However, the possibly heterogeneous reactions of international capital flows, particularly in relation to country-specific vulnerability and preparedness levels, have received limited attention in the literature so far. Here I find that, after controlling for factors such as countries' socio-economic and institutional disaster vulnerability as well as overall physical risk, portfolio and bank flows are highly sensitive to natural disasters, while foreign direct investment is not. Using a novel approach that groups countries by their level of vulnerability and disaster risk through k-means clustering, I compare the severity of extreme events from two key perspectives - population exposure and disaster duration - and contrast the effects of domestic and foreign catastrophes. I find three main results. First, in country groups with low disaster risk but classified as unprepared due to high vulnerability, a 1 percentage point increase in population exposure to a local disaster reduces portfolio inflows and outflows by 5 to 20 percentage points and bank outflows by 40 percentage points of GDP. Second, when foreign disasters hit other countries within the low disaster risk, but unprepared group, portfolio equity inflows increase by 36 percentage points in the home country, suggesting a shift of investment to safer regions. Finally, population exposure has a larger effect on capital flows than duration in all specifications, emphasizing the importance of human impact in financial decision-making. These findings indicate that unprepared countries with low disaster risk may experience increased financial volatility due to the high responsiveness of portfolio and bank flows. As extreme events are likely to become more frequent in the future, these countries may face an increased risk premium if governments do not improve their disaster preparedness strategies.

**Deleveraging and Foreign Currency Loan Conversion Programs in Europe**

*-joint with* [*Pınar Yeşin*](https://www.pinaryesin.com/), [*Comparative Economic Studies*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-020-00116-1)

This paper first reviews the developments in the size and composition of the European banking sectors’ balance sheets since the Global Financial Crisis and then assesses the impact of foreign currency loan conversion programs on systemic risk. Aggregate data from 2009Q1 to 2019Q3 indicate three major developments. First, the deleveraging process in Europe has been sizeable, while credit growth may be hampered in several countries. Secondly, macroprudential measures and conversion programs have only partially achieved their goal of lowering financial dollarization in Central and Eastern Europe. Lastly, systemic risk remains elevated in the non-euro area.
