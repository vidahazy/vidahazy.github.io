**The Impact of Natural Disasters on Capital Flows: Exposure and Preparedness**

*-available at request*

Natural disasters are becoming a growing source of macroeconomic shocks. In addition to their direct impact on growth and inflation, they may also affect future financial conditions, which would be reflected in current investment decisions. This paper analyses how a country's disaster preparedness and risk level affect capital flows. The results show that in countries with low disaster risk but poor preparedness, portfolio and bank flows fall sharply - by 5 to 20 percentage points of GDP - after a disaster, while foreign direct investment remains unaffected. This suggests that capital flows with lower investor commitment are more sensitive to disasters. In addition, external disasters in countries with similar risk profiles lead to a 39 percentage point increase in portfolio equity inflows, suggesting a shift in investment towards relatively safer regions.

**Deleveraging and Foreign Currency Loan Conversion Programs in Europe**

*-joint with* [*Pınar Yeşin*](https://www.pinaryesin.com/), [*Comparative Economic Studies*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-020-00116-1)

This paper first reviews the developments in the size and composition of the European banking sectors’ balance sheets since the Global Financial Crisis and then assesses the impact of foreign currency loan conversion programs on systemic risk. Aggregate data from 2009Q1 to 2019Q3 indicate three major developments. First, the deleveraging process in Europe has been sizeable, while credit growth may be hampered in several countries. Secondly, macroprudential measures and conversion programs have only partially achieved their goal of lowering financial dollarization in Central and Eastern Europe. Lastly, systemic risk remains elevated in the non-euro area.
