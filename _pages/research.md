**The Impact of Natural Disasters on Capital Flows: Exposure and Preparedness**

*-available at request*

Climate and weather-related natural disasters pose a growing threat to financial stability. This paper examines the impact of natural disasters on international capital flows, focusing on how country-specific preparedness and risk levels affect investor behaviour. Using k-means clustering, I categorise countries according to their disaster risk and preparedness. I find that portfolio and bank flows are highly sensitive to natural disasters in countries with low disaster risk but classified as unprepared, while foreign direct investment is not. Moreover, external natural disasters affect portfolio equity inflows, suggesting a shift in investment towards safer regions. These findings highlight the important role of disaster preparedness in mitigating financial risks from natural disasters.

**Deleveraging and Foreign Currency Loan Conversion Programs in Europe**

*-joint with* [*Pınar Yeşin*](https://www.pinaryesin.com/), [*Comparative Economic Studies*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-020-00116-1)

This paper first reviews the developments in the size and composition of the European banking sectors’ balance sheets since the Global Financial Crisis and then assesses the impact of foreign currency loan conversion programs on systemic risk. Aggregate data from 2009Q1 to 2019Q3 indicate three major developments. First, the deleveraging process in Europe has been sizeable, while credit growth may be hampered in several countries. Secondly, macroprudential measures and conversion programs have only partially achieved their goal of lowering financial dollarization in Central and Eastern Europe. Lastly, systemic risk remains elevated in the non-euro area.
