I am a PhD candidate at the [Geneva Graduate Institute](https://www.graduateinstitute.ch/discover-institute/viktoria-vidahazy).

My research interests lie in international economics, with a focus on climate change. I explore the impact of climate change through both physical and transition risks, examining international economics from investment and banking perspectives. My research approach emphasizes rigorous identification, using innovative instruments and methods to establish causal effects. I use high-frequency, micro-level data such as credit registries and interdisciplinary data from climate and policy sources to uncover new insights and address complex questions in the field.

I have previously worked at different policy institutions, including the [Research Division at the Sveriges Riksbank](https://www.riksbank.se/en-gb/about-the-riksbank/the-tasks-of-the-riksbank/research/economists-at-the-research-division/), the European Department at the International Monetary Fund, and the International Policy Analysis unit at the Swiss National Bank. I visited the [Centre For Macroeconomics at LSE](https://www.lse.ac.uk/CFM) during the Winter and Spring terms of 2023-2024.
